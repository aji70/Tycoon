# SelfClaw agent verification

When implementing or discussing **AI agent verification**, **SelfClaw**, **wallet verification**, or **ERC-8004 on-chain identity**, read and follow the official skill:

**https://selfclaw.ai/skill.md**

That skill covers:
- Verifying AI agents as human-backed (SelfClaw registry, Self.xyz passport ZK proofs)
- Creating EVM wallets and registering on-chain identity (ERC-8004)
- Celo as default chain for identity and gas
- Wallet verification for games/dApps: `GET https://selfclaw.ai/api/selfclaw/v1/wallet-verify/0xYourWallet`
- API flows: start-verification, sign-challenge, verification-status, agent lookup by publicKey or name

If the user says "use SelfClaw" or "verify my agent" or "read selfclaw.ai/skill.md", fetch that URL and apply its instructions.
