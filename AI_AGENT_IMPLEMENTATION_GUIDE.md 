## 🎯 Overview

This guide will help you implement and enhance AI Agent functionality in your Tycoon game. You already have a solid foundation with basic AI players, but this guide will help you create a more sophisticated, autonomous AI agent system.

### What You Already Have ✅

- ✅ AI player creation (`createAIGame` in contract)
- ✅ AI player detection (`isAIPlayer` utility)
- ✅ Basic AI auto-actions (`useAIAutoActions` hook)
- ✅ AI bankruptcy handling (`useAiBankruptcy` hook)
- ✅ AI game board (`ai-board` component)
- ✅ AI player settings page (`play-ai` page)

### What This Guide Adds 🚀

- 🚀 Enhanced AI decision-making system
- 🚀 Backend AI agent service
- 🚀 Advanced strategy algorithms
- 🚀 AI agent configuration system
- 🚀 Performance monitoring and metrics

## 🏗 Architecture

### Recommended Architecture

```
Frontend (React)
├── AI Hooks (AutoActions, Bankruptcy, Strategy)
├── AI Components (Board, Players, Settings)
└── AI Context (State, Config)

        ↕ WebSocket/HTTP

Backend (Express.js)
├── AI Service (Decision, Strategy)
├── Game Logic (State Mgmt, Validation)
└── Socket.io (Real-time Events)

        ↕

Smart Contract (Solidity)
├── Game State (On-chain)
├── AI Players (Addresses)
└── Transactions (Actions)
```

## 🛠 Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Create AI Agent Service (Backend)

Create: `backend/services/aiAgentService.js`

This service contains the core AI decision-making logic with different difficulty levels.

### Step 2: Create AI Agent Controller (Backend)

Create: `backend/controllers/aiAgentController.js`

This controller handles API requests for AI decisions and actions.

### Step 3: Add AI Routes (Backend)

Create: `backend/routes/aiAgentRoutes.js`

Add routes to your Express server.

### Step 4: Create Enhanced AI Hook (Frontend)

Create: `frontend/hooks/useEnhancedAI.ts`

This hook connects to your backend AI service.

### Step 5: Integrate into Board Component

Update: `frontend/components/game/ai-board/ai-board.tsx`

## 📝 Code Files to Create

I'll provide the complete code for each file. See the detailed implementation sections below.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Backend Setup:**
   - Create `backend/services/aiAgentService.js`
   - Create `backend/controllers/aiAgentController.js`
   - Create `backend/routes/aiAgentRoutes.js`
   - Update `backend/server.js` to include routes

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   - Create `frontend/hooks/useEnhancedAI.ts`
   - Update `frontend/components/game/ai-board/ai-board.tsx`

3. **Test:**
   - Start a game with AI players
   - Verify AI makes decisions
   - Check console logs for debugging
